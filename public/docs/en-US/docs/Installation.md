# Installation

`NeatUI` currently consists of two parts: `@neatui/css` and `@neatui/vue`. `@neatui/css` is an atomic style library that can be used in any project and can be shared with other UI component libraries. While `@neatui/vue` only supports Vue3 projects, using `@neatui/vue` must be based on `@neatui/css`.

## NPM

Install using npm.

```sh
npm i @neatui/css @neatui/vue
```
