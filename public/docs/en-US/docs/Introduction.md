# NeatUI

`NeatUI` consists of an atomic style library `@neatui/css` and a component library `@neatui/vue`. It aims to provide developers with a UI frontend architecture based on the quasi-standard design specification, featuring multi-theme switching, multi-level font size switching, and responsive multi-platform support. It boasts more precise dimension responsiveness and finer layout control capabilities than other frameworks. We are committed to building an ultimate front-end UI framework for an exceptional user experience.

`@neatui/css` is a pure style library that can be used independently, but `@neatui/vue` must be used based on `@neatui/css`.

## Features

- • Automatically generate multi-theme color palettes that comply with design principles
- • Support for global multi-level font size management
- • More precise responsive control system
- • Very fine-tuned typography adjustment system
- • Less than 10% of styles are handwritten based on atomic style library
