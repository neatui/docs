# Naive UI

`Naive UI` consists of an atomic style library `@naiveui/css` and a component library `@naiveui/vue`. It aims to provide developers with a UI frontend architecture based on the quasi-standard design specification, featuring multi-theme switching, multi-level font size switching, and responsive multi-platform support. It boasts more precise dimension responsiveness and finer layout control capabilities than other frameworks. We are committed to building an ultimate front-end UI framework for an exceptional user experience.
`@naiveui/css` is a pure style library that can be used independently, but `@naiveui/vue` must be used based on `@naiveui/css`.

## Features

- Supports customizable multi-theming, automatically generating dynamically calculated colors compliant with design principles and color recognition standards
- Supports global multi-font size switching
- More precise responsive control system
- Finer layout fine-tuning system
