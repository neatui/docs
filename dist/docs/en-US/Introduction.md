# Naive UI

<p><code>Naive UI</code> consists of an atomic style library <code>@naiveui/css</code> and a component library <code>@naiveui/vue</code>. It aims to provide developers with a UI frontend architecture based on the quasi-standard design specification, featuring multi-theme switching, multi-level font size switching, and responsive multi-platform support. It boasts more precise dimension responsiveness and finer layout control capabilities than other frameworks. We are committed to building an ultimate front-end UI framework for an exceptional user experience.</p>
<p><code>@naiveui/css</code> is a pure style library that can be used independently, but <code>@naiveui/vue</code> must be used based on <code>@naiveui/css</code>.</p>

## Features

- Supports customizable multi-theming, automatically generating dynamically calculated colors compliant with design principles and color recognition standards
